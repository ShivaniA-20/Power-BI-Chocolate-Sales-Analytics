# Chocolate Sales Analytics - Power BI Project

## Summary

This project analyzes the sales performance of Chocolate Alchemy, a fictional chocolate company. The objective is to assess the performance of salespersons, products, and geographies while identifying trends and key metrics such as Total Sales, Total Profit, and Low Box Shipments. Month-on-month and year-on-year changes in metrics are also explored to support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of five tables modeled in a star schema:

- __Fact Table__: Shipments
- __Dimension Tables__:
  1. Sales Person
  2. Product
  3. Geography
  4. Date


Each shipment represents chocolates sold by a salesperson for a specific product to a geography on a particular date.

## Objectives
1. Create an *star schema* model for Chocolate Sales using Power BI.

2. Calculate and analyze key metrics, including:
   - Total Sales
   - Total Boxes
   - Total Shipments
   - Total Cost
   - Total Profit
   - Profit Percentage
   - Low Box Shipments and their percentage
   - Month-on-month changes in sales and profit
3. Build dynamic, interactive dashboards to uncover actionable insights.

## Steps
1. __Data Preparation__:
- Loaded the data into Power BI and created a star schema model.
- Built relationships between the Fact table and Dimension tables.

2. __Data Transformation__:
- Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query Editor.
- Created measures for KPIs like Total Sales, Profit Percentage, and Month-on-Month Changes.
  
3. __Visualization__:
- Developed interactive dashboards with visuals like Stacked Bar Charts, Line Graphs, Cards, and TreeMaps to analyze data comprehensively.


## Visualizations
1. __Profit Analysis by Product__:
- Displayed profit across products using a Stacked Bar Chart. Peanut Butter Cubes were the most profitable product, while Bakers Choco Chips underperformed.

2. __Low Box Shipments__:
- Created a KPI to track shipments with fewer than 50 boxes, revealing inefficiencies in operations. Milk Bars had the highest Low Box Shipments (LBS).

3. __Month-on-Month Trends__:
- Analyzed changes in Total Sales and Profit using Line Graphs to detect seasonal trends and performance patterns.
